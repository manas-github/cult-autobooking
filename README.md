# cult-autobooking
For folks who don’t know what Cult is, it is a mix of group workouts for one’s fitness needs. For me it was mostly Boxing, HRX and Strength & Conditioning. The group size is around 30 people and booking is strictly FCFS. Regular members (like me) can book 4 days in advance, while members who have been in the system for a while (level 3 and above) can book 7 days in advance.
I joined cult at the time when gyms are floodeed,i.e around new year’s, where getting a slot was close to impossible. My preferred slot is usually the morning 6–8 am slot. Most of this slot was booked by the Level3+ members 7 days in-advance, while very few slots were left for beginners to enroll. The slot booking would open at every night and by the time I would check for availability, they would be all gone.
After missing many sessions, it was time to sit down, spend some time and automate the booking so that i would not miss it ever again.
